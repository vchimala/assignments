1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?

String: Use it when you have only a few string operations or when the string is not likely to change. String is immutable, so each time you modify it, a new string object is created. This can be inefficient if you need to change the string repeatedly.
StringBuilder: Use this when you need to make many changes to a string (like adding, removing, or modifying parts of it). It’s mutable, which means it doesn’t create a new object every time you change it, making it much faster for these types of operations.



2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?

The base class for all arrays in C# is System.Array. This class provides various methods and properties to work with arrays.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?

You can sort an array using the Array.Sort() method.
 For example:

int[] numbers = { 5, 2, 8, 1, 3 };
Array.Sort(numbers);

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?

The Length property tells you how many elements are in the array.
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
int totalElements = numbers.Length; 
output:4

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?

No, System.Array is designed to hold elements of the same type. If you need to store different data types together, you might use collections like ArrayList or List<object>, but these aren’t as safe since they don’t enforce a specific type.

6. What’s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
Practice Arrays

Array.CopyTo():
This method copies elements from one array to another existing array, starting at a specific index. You need to make sure the target array already has enough space to hold the copied elements.
Array.Clone():
This creates a shallow copy of the entire array and returns a new array with the same elements and length. It’s a quick way to duplicate an array.
